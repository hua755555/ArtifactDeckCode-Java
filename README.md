# ArtifactDeckCode-Java

A java port of https://github.com/ValveSoftware/ArtifactDeckCode

+ [ok] Deck Decoding 
- [not yet] Deck Encoding
+ [ok] Card Set API Client with local cache

# notes:
`neoeutil.jar` is a util jar provided within jar format but you can decompile if you're interested. 

Why valve use PHP? (perverts?) I guess it's ported from C because the function interfaces are so likely to C, without OOP.
